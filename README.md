# html-slides

A little blob of CSS and JavaScript for making slide presentations by writing simple HTML.

See the demo site at: https://andybalaam.github.io/html-slides/demo.html

## Example HTML

You can use any HTML in a slide, but bulleted lists and code samples are my most common slides:

```
<a name="slide_1"></a>
<div class="slide">
<div class="slide_body">
<h1>Write slides in HTML</h1>
<ul>
    <li>It's more fun than LibreOffice</li>
    <li>And you can put it in source control</li>
    <li>And your stuff is web searchable</li>
    <li>No flash or downloads</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
```
